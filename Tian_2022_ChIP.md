# Re-analyses of the Tian et al 2022 ChIP using the greenscreen pipeline
- Tian et al 2022 paper [here](https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/34/8/2969/6580212#367433007)
- Klasfeld et al 2022 paper [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.27.482177v1)\
Tian et al used IgG as control for EMF2b ChIP, let's try using input instead

## 1. import raw fastq file ##
--> Setup prerequisets and Greenscreen conda environment
```bash
srun --mem=20g --pty bash -l
cd Tian_2022TPC_ChIP
module load sratoolkit/2.11.2
module load Anaconda/2019.10
conda activate CondaGS
```
Installed sound effect to be notify on command runnin more than 5seconds by following [this](https://github.com/c0rp-aubakirov/notify_after_command_executed/)
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/c0rp-aubakirov/notify_after_command_executed.git
 cd notify_after_command_executed/
 echo "source $(pwd)/postexec_notify" >> ~/.bashrc
 ```
 Restart terminal and tested if notification appear after 5sec ```sleep 6``` : \
 @FAIL:  Does not work when I restart, mention "postexec_notify: No such file or directory"
 
--> Download files from the SRA (paired end mode):\
*Files information can be found in ChIP analyses Tan et al 2022.xlsx*

Submitted batch job 197763=FAIL\
**output:**\
Error: Could not find or load main class TMP_DIR=tmp
**troubleshoots:**\
- Try to put the tmp-related argument at the end of the command
Submitted batch job 197764=WORK BUT NEW FAIL\
**output:**\
```
[SEVERE][Biostar145820]There was an error in the command line arguments. Please check your parameters : Expected one or zero argument but got 3 : [mapped/chip/EMF2_Rep2.dupmark.sorted.bam, -Djava.io.tmpdir=tmp, TMP_DIR=tmp]
com.github.lindenb.jvarkit.lang.JvarkitException$CommandLineError: There was an error in the command line arguments. Please check your parameters : Expected one or zero argument but got 3

```
**troubleshoots:**\
- Remove the ```TMP_DIR=tmp```
Submitted batch job 197769=DONE\
Last=2hrs for 2 sample with 2 replicates\
**Troubleshootings Conclusion:** The java syntax was not good; For me ```-Xmx2g -Djava.io.tmpdir=tmp``` (store temporary file to tmp folder and allow 2G max) needs to be in between ```java``` (call java) and ```-jar``` (JAR file is used: biostar145820.jar); Then other arguments ```-n``` minimum number of read in one of the replicate; ```--seed 42``` (because that is the number of the universe, lol, could be any number... That is to generate randomness and reproducibility as a subset of the reads are taken)

--> Call peak IP to input control individually\
```bash
module load Anaconda/2019.10
conda activate CondaGS

```
**troubleshoots:**\
Seems OK to ignore the error. Nevertheless, seems to be cause by not enough space in temporary shared folder, let's try adding one with the option ```--tempdir PATH```
```bash
module load Anaconda/2019.10
conda activate CondaGS
sbatch scripts/macs2_callpeaks_test.sh
```
Submitted batch job 197801=DONE but other FAIL\
No more error message but files are the same so that could have been ignore.\

```--binSize 1``` for good resolution; ```--scaleFactor 0.5``` to obtain the exact number of reads respective to the bam, otherwise it count two instead of 1.; ```--extendReads``` Reads extented taking into account mean fragment size of all mated reads.

wiggletool merge parameter, install it from git:

Try install through Conda instead:\
Go to new conda environment just in case\
```bash

```
DONE, bigwig mean > bedGraph > bigwig
```bash

```
DONE\
**Troubleshootings Conclusion:** Command to use to pool 2 bigwig:
```bash
conda activate CondaUmap
wiggletools write_bg mapped/chip/downsample/H3K27me3.wig mean mapped/chip/downsample/H3K27me3_Rep1.dupmark.sorted.bw mapped/chip/downsample/H3K27me3_Rep2.dupmark.sorted.bw

**Alternative:** I may also make a wig from the pooled bam file

## Conclusion 1 ##

- H3K27me3 peaks identified are quite comparable in between greenscreen and Tan pipeline (XX% overlap)
- Much more EMF2 peaks identified using greenscreen pipeline as compare to Tan analyses (XX% more)
--> Let's now remove the H3K27me3 and EMF2 peaks that overlap with IgG peaks see what we obtain


## 3. Pursue analyses (Peak calling broad IgG and filtered out overlapping H3K27me3 and EMF2 peaks) ##
Call peaks IgG to input\
```bash
sbatch scripts/macs2_callpeaks_broad_IGG.sh
sbatch scripts/macs2_callpeaks_broad1.sh
```
Submitted batch job 197875= DONE, FAIL at filtering p-value and removing greenscreen region (corrected in the script macs2_callpeaks_broad_IGG.sh, but launch aditional to correct)\
Submitted batch job 197876= DONE\

Only 28 peaks has been called! That is very few, thus likely not change downstream analyses...\
To make it change, let's decrease the qvalue for calling the peaks from 10 to 5\
```bash
sbatch scripts/macs2_callpeaks_broad_IGG.sh # q value edited from 10 to 5 
```
Submitted batch job 197926=DONE\
Similarly, only 53 peaks identified.\
--> let's only remove the H3K27me3 and EMF2b peaks overlapping with the 28 IgG peaks using bedtools:
```bash
bedtools intersect -a data/macs2_out/chipPeaks/broad_gsMask_qval10/H3K27me3_pool_peaks.broadPeak -b data/macs2_out/chipPeaks/broad_gsMask_qval10/IgG_peaks.broadPeak -v > data/peaks_for_comparison/H3K27me3_noIgG.broadPeak
```



## 4. Annotate peaks to genes ##

Minor issues:
- Mapping only work on node01 or node03
