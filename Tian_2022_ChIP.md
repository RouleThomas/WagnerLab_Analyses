# Re-analyses of the Tian et al 2022 ChIP using the greenscreen pipeline
- Tian et al 2022 paper [here](https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/34/8/2969/6580212#367433007)
- Klasfeld et al 2022 paper [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.27.482177v1)\
Tian et al used IgG as control for EMF2b ChIP, let's try using input instead

## 1. import raw fastq file ##
--> Setup prerequisets and Greenscreen conda environment
```
srun --mem=20g --pty bash -l
cd Tian_2022TPC_ChIP
module load sratoolkit/2.11.2
module load Anaconda/2019.10
conda activate CondaGS
```
Installed sound effect to be notify on command runnin more than 5seconds by following [this](https://github.com/c0rp-aubakirov/notify_after_command_executed/)
```
 git clone https://github.com/c0rp-aubakirov/notify_after_command_executed.git
 cd notify_after_command_executed/
 echo "source $(pwd)/postexec_notify" >> ~/.bashrc
 ```
 Restart terminal and tested if notification appear after 5sec ```sleep 6``` : \
 @FAIL:  Does not work when I restart, mention "postexec_notify: No such file or directory"

Minor issues:
- Mapping only work on node01 or node03
